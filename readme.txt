The Bitmovin Wordpress Plugin provides best video quality via HTML5 adaptive streaming
with fast startup, no buffering and without additional plugins!


== Description ==

The Bitmovin Wordpress Plugin comes up with a lot of features and services.

Bitmovin HTML5 Adaptive Player

The Bitmovin Adaptive Streaming Player is a highly optimised MPEG-DASH & HLS player for various platforms and devices,
delivering the best streaming performance and user experience, particular in adverse (mobile) network conditions.
bitdash™ is the result of continued R&D investments and incorporates patent pending technology resulting in MPEG-DASH compliant client solutions
that deliver up to 101 % higher effective media throughput as well as significantly higher Quality of Experience (QoE)
compared to existing adaptive bitrate streaming technologies and clients.

It also comes with a lot of features:

- DRM support
- Ad support
- VR and 360°
- Encoding Service (HLS or MPEG-DASH)
- Fastest loading times


Bitmovin Encoding Service

The Bitmovin Wordpress Plugin also encodes your videos into modern Adaptive Bitrate Streaming formats such as MPEG-DASH and HLS.
When uploading multimedia files via Wordpress, the Plugin automatically convert them via the Bitmovin Encoding service running in background into those formats.

The general workflow is a follows: Your input videos can be uploaded by the provided wordpress upload page and can the be
encoded with the Encoding Feature of the Bitmovin Plugin into MPEG-DASH and HLS formats used for streaming.
Bitmovin transfers the encoded asset back to your storage. From this storage you can directly deliver your videos to your customers.
These cutting edge adaptive streaming formats enable smooth playback without buffering and low startup delay at the highest possible quality.
Your input videos can be transfered to our cloud encoding service through various input protocols
such as HTTP or FTP servers, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Aspera


VR and 360° Video and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

The Bitmovin Wordpress Plugin utilizes the browser build-in HTML5 Media Source Extensions (MSE)
to playback VR and omnidirectional content natively through the browser decoding engine.
This playout technique is available on most modern web browsers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Why does the player show the error message "Your player is not allowed to play on the domain evil.com"? =

The player contacts our licensing server to detect if it is allowed to play on the current domain.
Browser extensions, like Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows CORS requests without honoring CORS headers from the server, but in return changes the origin from the actual domain to evil.com.
Please disable/remove such extensions and the player should work as expected.


= I get the error message  "1002: Key or domain is invalid" =

The error is shown, because either the key you entered in the configuration is incorrect or
if you are using the URL you entered during the checkout process, is not valid or incorrect.
Non-valid URLs can for instance be caused by incorrect sub-domains, the URL you provided does not fully match the URL of the deployment,
or you entered an IP address instead of the domain name.


= I setup the Bitmovin player, but no video element is shown" =

This can have different reasons.
Please open the console of your web browser (e.g. by pressing F12 in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox),
which provides information in more detail on possible errors.


= Why do I see error messages in my browser's console? =

The error messages as shown in the image below may appear in a browser’s console.
This is not a bitmovin player error, but the errors are thrown from Google’s ChromeCast SDK if the Cast extensions can’t be found.
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to prevent these errors from happening or from showing up in the console, as explained by the developers in the related Google Cast SDK issue.
These errors do not prevent your website or the bitmovin player from working as expected. ChromeCast errors in browser’s console This affects pro and enterprise edition only..


= Why are the colors of my video not the same in different browsers? =

The bitmovin player relies on the browser’s capabilities to decode and render the video.
This has the advantage to be able to use hardware decoding which is much faster and also better for battery life / energy consumption than software decoding.
But different browsers may use different encoders with different settings.
This difference is especially visible between HTML5 and FLASH videos.
So unfortunately we can not change this behaviour.


= The player is not loading segments, altough the MPD is correct? =

If the player is not loading segments which lies on another server,
make sure CORS (for the HTML5 player) is enabled a crossdomain.xml
(for the Flash based version of bitdash) is placed on the server containing the element.
